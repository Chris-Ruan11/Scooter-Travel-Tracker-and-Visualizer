Scooters are awesome. This app is gonna be proof
Tracks scooter trips, even when phone is locked. Tracks data to show the time saved vs walking, money saved from time , and money saved compared to a bird. 
Also includes locations visited heatmap, which will add a travel tracking element to the app, showing where I've scooted and how often.
For tracking, the app will automatically sense when the trip actually begins and ends, so that you can take time to settle down before pressing the stop trip button, and take some time to get ready after pressing start scoot.
